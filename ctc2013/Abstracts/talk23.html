<h3>Epistatic networks influencing diabetes-related phenotypes in mice</h3>

<p>Genetic interactions influencing complex traits are typically weaker than single-locus main effects and can be difficult to detect even in populations sufficiently powered to detect main effects. Moreover, partial correlation of traits often confounds interpretation of epistatic interactions. Here we present a method to infer and interpret epistasis in the context of partially correlated complex traits. This method, the Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis (CAPE), increases power to detect interactions by leveraging complementary information across related traits. CAPE infers interactions as directed influences between genetic variants. Positive influences, indicating enhancement, and negative influences, indicating suppression, link gene variants together in a network that predicts intuitively how variants interact to affect traits. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of CAPE by reanalyzing a previously published study of obesity and diabetes. The original analysis examined a reciprocal backcross between non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and New Zealand obese (NZO) mice to discover main-effect and epistatic QTL affecting traits associated with obesity-related diabetes. Here we show that we have increased power to infer an epistatic network influencing multiple diabetes-related traits. In addition to QTL associated with the coincidence of high plasma glucose levels and obesity, we find QTL involved in the divergence between plasma glucose levels and obesity. We also find that maternal effects modify a subset of QTL associated with body weight, plasma glucose and insulin levels.</p>
