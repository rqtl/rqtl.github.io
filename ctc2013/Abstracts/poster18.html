<p>Genetic factors determining exercise capacity and the magnitude of the response to exercise training are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with exercise training in mice.  Based on marked differences in training responses in inbred NZW (-0.65 ± 1.73 min) and 129S1 (4.31 ± 2.79 min) mice, a reciprocal intercross breeding scheme was used to generate 288 F2 mice.  All F2 mice completed an exercise performance test before and after a 4-week treadmill running program, resulting in an increase in exercise capacity of 1.54 ± 3.69 min (range   -10 to +12 min).  Genome-wide linkage scans were performed for pre-training, post-training, and change in run time.  For pre-training exercise time, suggestive QTL were identified on Chromosomes 5 (57.4 cM, 2.5 LOD) and 6 (39.8 cM, 2.8 LOD).  Suggestive QTL for post-training exercise capacity were identified on Chrs 1 (52.0 cM, 2.2 LOD) and 5 (43.4 cM, 3.3 LOD).  A suggestive QTL for the change in run time was identified on Chr 6 (37.8 cM, 2.9 LOD).  To identify shared QTL, this data set was combined with data from a cross between B6 and FVB strains.  In the combined cross analysis, a significant novel QTL for pre-training exercise time was identified on Chr 12 (54.0 cM, 3.45 LOD) and a suggestive QTL for post-training exercise capacity on Chr 8 (23.9 cM, 2.92 LOD).  These data indicate that one or more QTL determine exercise capacity and training responses in mice.  Supported by HL-085918.</p>
