<p>The Diversity Outbred (DO) population is a heterogeneous stock derived from the same eight founder strains as the Collaborative Cross inbred strains. This talk will summarize the status of DO colony, which is in the 14th generation of outbreeding as of May 2013. Several large projects are underway using DO mice to investigate genetics of complex traits.  New genotyping resources and analytical tools have been developed to support these studies.  Accumulation of recombination events in the DO is tracking predicted rate.  However there was a major distortion in the founder allele frequencies driven by a selective sweep of WSB allele on chromosome 2. Corrective action was taken to restore allelic balance in this region.  We will present empirical results and simulations to support sample size and other study design decisions.   The DO is thriving and ready for widespread adoption by this community.</p>
