<p>The large size and hexaploid nature of the bread wheat genome have thus far made it difficult to gain a deeper understanding of its structure. However, with advances in sequencing capability, the number of available genetic markers in wheat has increased dramatically in recent years. Now strategies are required to transform these data into knowledge useful for gene discovery. We have been developing two large Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) genetic resource populations to more quickly achieve these goals. We will describe our research in these populations towards developing a high-density genetic map and discuss progress in characterizing the genetic landscape in bread wheat. <p></p>
