<h3>Uncovering trans-eQTL Relationships in Gene Networks</h3>

<p>System genetics approaches are a key strategy for uncovering the genetics of complex traits. However, we still have limited understanding of how genetic information is transmitted through gene networks to complex traits. One key obstacle is the difficulty in identifying trans-eQTL relationships. We can readily identify cis relationships, but it has proven difficult to trace the influence of genetic variants deeper into gene networks than their cis gene.  Low power to detect trans effects is presumably a major factor. The very large multiple testing correction inherent in eQTL mapping makes eQTL effects only be detectable at rather large effect sizes. In this talk, we demonstrate an approach for reducing the multiple testing burden and thereby increasing power for mapping trans eQTLs.  We follow a two-part strategy that is based on the hypothesis that cis effects for one gene will often be trans effects for genes that interact with that gene in gene networks. Consider a set of genes that have been clustering into co-expression modules. First, we conduct eQTL mapping of each gene only to its cis markers in order to identify cis effects.  Next, each gene is then mapped against only markers that were found to have significant cis effects for other genes in the same module. This greatly reduces the multiple testing burden and focuses the tests on markers most likely to have trans effects. Using a mouse obesity data set, we show that this approach greatly increases the number of trans-eQTL effects detected. Many co-expression modules are found to have large number of -trans-eQTL relationships. We give an overview of the trans relationships thus uncovered. The most common pattern is that gene modules contain large numbers of genes with reciprocal trans-eQTL relationships.</p>
