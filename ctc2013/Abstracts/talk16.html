<p>We mapped numerous diabetes-related traits in an F2 inter-cross between obese (Lepob/ob) C57BL/6 (diabetes resistant) and obese BTBR (diabetes susceptible) mice. We obtained a strong linkage for plasma insulin to a locus on chromosome 2. We also mapped eQTL traits for 6 tissues (pancreatic islets, liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, kidney and hypothalamus). In islets, the expression of ~600 transcripts mapped in trans to the same region on chromosome 2 as plasma insulin. These transcripts included 36 genes previously identified in human GWAS as having an association for T2D. We asked if the islet genes mapping to the chromosome 2 locus were enriched for a motif in their promoter that is consistent with any known transcription factor. The promoter region of 85 genes were enriched for a motif recognized by Nfatc2 (p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>), which is physically located at the locus. Finally, a formal test for causality (QTLChr2 → Genecis → Genetrans) identified Nfatc2 as the strongest candidate regulator of the trans-mapping expression traits at the chromosome 2 locus. The overexpression of a constitutively active form of Nfatc2 in mouse islets significantly augmented insulin secretion in response to several insulin secretagogues. In summary, four lines of evidence converged on Nfatc2 as a critical regulator of beta-cell function.</p>
