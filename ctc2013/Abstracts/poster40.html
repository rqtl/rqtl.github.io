<p><strong>Sue McClatchy and Gary Churchill</strong></br>

<em>The Jackson Laboratory</em></p>

<p>Independent Studies in Computational Biology delivers an award-winning* form of education that partners high school students and teachers with investigators who generate and analyze large-scale data (genomedynamics.org/education/iscb.shtml). Students engage in a hypothesis-driven approach to large-scale data analysis under the guidance of the investigator. They acquire skills and knowledge in quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, R programming, genetics, statistics, and the art of scientific communication. Students are active partners in our groupâ€™s research and some have published in peer-reviewed journals.<p>We engage talented high school students in research and expect graduate-level performance from them. We deliver background information, offer guidance, and assess scientific process and communication skills during weekly web conferences to student research teams located along the length of the East Coast. On-site educators support research teams by reinforcing information that we present, directing students to web tools and resources for advancing their research, debugging R code, and reviewing student presentations prior to delivery.<p>Large-scale data analysis requires many hands, and we welcome investigators and educators to join us during weekly web conferences to learn how to implement our model of distributed research and education. Our delivery method employs hybrid online learning with in-class support from educators and any-time access to online resources. It is unique and different, though, in that students have real-time guidance from a principal investigator at a distance. <p>* To be announced in the May 31 edition of Science magazine</p>
