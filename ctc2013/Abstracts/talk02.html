<p>The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from eight genetically diverse laboratory inbred strains.  The CC External Advisory board recommended establishing a small set of CC lines that can be rapidly accessed by researchers for pilot studies, initial phenotyping and/or proof of concept experiments. To that end, we established a set of 12 CC lines (hereby named Tier 1 lines) in which every line has all eight founders represented, the average residual heterozygosity is 7.6% (range 2.6 to 10.9%) and the average litter size is 4.1 (range 3.0 â€“ 5.6). Tier 1 includes lines from all three original populations: six from UNC, three from TAU and three from Geniad. These lines have been renamed starting with CC001 and are listed at csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py? The number and identity of Tier 1 lines will not change.  The UNC distribution center has another 34 CC lines that are currently available based on the criteria described previously<sup>1</sup>. These additional lines consist of 13 from UNC, 4 from TAU and 17 from Geniad.  The number of available lines should increase as more lines reach the inbreeding threshold. Here we provide a description of the status of the CC in the US and distribution efforts by the UNC at Chapel Hill Systems Genetics Core.  Recent changes in the breeding, husbandry and genotyping will be discussed.<p><sup>1</sup>Welsh CE, Miller DR, Manly KF, Wang J, McMillan L, Morahan G, Mott R, Iraqi FA, Threadgill DW, Pardo-Manuel de Villena, F.
