<h3>Interactive graphics for high-dimensional genetic data</h3>

<p>The value of interactive, dynamic graphics for making sense of high-dimensional data has long been appreciated but is still not in routine use.  I will describe my efforts to develop interactive graphical tools for applications in genetics, using JavaScript and D3. I will focus on an expression genetics experiment in the mouse, with gene expression microarray data on each of six tissues, plus high-density genotype data, in each of 500 mice.  I argue that in research with such data, precise statistical inference is not so important as data visualization.</p>
